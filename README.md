// PowerCalculator 1.0.0
Designed & Developed by Andrew Hong (u/novialriptide)

Calculate your GPA without manually putting your grades in a calculator. In addition,
you can also check your tests and homework average by each course.

This website uses the Python selenium api library to simulate a web browser to access
the client's PowerSchool account. This does not use the requests library to prevent
PowerSchool blocking the program's webscraping method.
